[Check out my dotfiles here!](https://git.tayari.gg/tayari/dotfiles)


### Curated ICO:

- Working in a coordinated team environment to develop a data aggregation and analysis platform for the crypto space.
- Designed an SQL database schema to meet specific requirements and deployed it to a PostgreSQL database.
- Built and configured a GraphQL API to allow interactions with the PostgreSQL database.

### To-Do Export:

- Covered a gap in the Microsoft To-Do program by devising a unique and custom solution which exports task lists into a format compatible with other task management applications.
- Developed in Java and utilises REST APIs to retrieve the task lists which are then convereted into appropriate CSV and JSON formats.
- Was developed following a personal need to export my task lists from Microsoft To-Do to another task management application and there were no guides, tools or in-app feature that allowed me to export my task lists, let alone in a format that would be compatible to be imported in other task management applications.

### Discord Bots:

For various reasons, I have created numerous Discord bots, built in JavaScript using NodeJS and the `Discord.js` NPM package.
- [Topic Bot](https://git.tayari.gg/tayari/Topic-Bot): Discord bot which following a particular message being sent in chat, posts a topic or conversation prompt, taken from a given list of prompts. Also allows users to both control the bot and add new prompts directly through Discord, allowing them to not have to go manually edit the files every time. 
- [Discord Embedder](https://git.tayari.gg/tayari/discord-embedder): Discord bot which takes in a given input and creates and posts the content in an embed format.


### Pi-Hole Blocklist:

Created an extensive blocklist for the DNS sinkhole Pi-Hole, compiled from numerous other blocklists and then further customised by myself.
